## Contributor License Agreement
Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a [Contributor License Agreement](https://forms.gle/nnNZjB7P1YPuEHb69). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. 

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.


## How to Contribute
We'd love to accept your innovations, enhancements, patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

* One of the first things you want to look for is a contributing.md file. We have one here. This file will tell you how the maintainers of the project want to handle contributions and also contains instructions for setting up the project.
* If you're unsure what you would like to do, search the issues. All GitHub projects have a * help wanted * label that maintainers can use to assign to issues they would like help on. Some projects add other labels to issues.
* Look at the issues and labels. In this particular project, you may see that there are three issues raised by other contributors too. Some of them have the help wanted label. Maybe this is something that we could work on.
* Once you've found an issue you want to work on for filed one yourself, ask in the comments if there's a way you can help out. If you're new, let the project maintainer know and ask if they can help you get your first pull request into the project.
* It's important that you come up with the basic idea of the solution with the project maintainer before you start working on the solution. You don't want to spend hours working on a feature just to realize the maintainer won't accept it.

Great. You and the project maintainer agree that it's absolutely necessary to have the feature implementation from DIGIT. Now we can start implementing this feature.
