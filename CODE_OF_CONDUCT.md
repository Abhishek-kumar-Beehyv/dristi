## Respectful behavior includes:

 * Being considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
 * Not engaging in demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, sexualized, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
 * Not engaging in unwanted physical contact.
 * Some eGov's open source projects may adopt an explicit project code of conduct, which may have additional detailed expectations for participants. Most of those projects will use our modified Contributor Covenant.

## Resolve peacefully
We do not believe that all conflict is necessarily bad; healthy debate and disagreement often yields positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.
